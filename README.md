# Flask-Mail

This is a simple application used for sending emails using Python's Flask framework. It is a spin-off of Mailtrap's tutorial available at https://mailtrap.io/blog/flask-email-sending/. As apps grow, developers will often restructure their code from a single file to multiple folders. This is an example of how to set up Flask-Mail in conjunction with Mailtrap. 
To use this code, you will need to set up an account with Mailtrap (https://mailtrap.io/register/signup?ref=header) and substitute your own credentials for the username and password on lines 17 and 18 in __init__.py.
